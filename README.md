# Open-Source-Project
Use any open source software to capture the data of the application. For reference, from a pcap file, use any opensource software to extract each email  (POP, IMAP, and SMTP protocols), all HTTP contents, each VoIP call.

* To capture data from an application, you can use open-source software like Wireshark, which is a network protocol analyzer that can capture and analyze network traffic. Here are the steps to capture data from an application using Wireshark:
-Download and install Wireshark from their official website.
Open Wireshark and select the interface you want to capture traffic on, for example, Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
Start capturing traffic by clicking on the "Capture" button. Wireshark will start capturing packets and displaying them in real-time.
Once you have captured the traffic, you can save it as a pcap file by selecting "File" -> "Save As" and choosing the pcap format.

*To extract each email (POP, IMAP, and SMTP protocols) from the pcap file:
Open the saved pcap file in Wireshark.
Use the filter tool to select the email protocols you want to extract. For example, you can use the filter "smtp || pop || imap" to select SMTP, POP, and IMAP protocols.
Wireshark will display all the email packets captured in the pcap file. You can right-click on a packet and select "Follow TCP Stream" to see the entire email message.
To save the extracted emails, select "File" -> "Export Objects" -> "HTTP" and choose the emails you want to export.

*To extract all HTTP contents from the pcap file:
Open the saved pcap file in Wireshark.
Use the filter tool to select HTTP packets. For example, you can use the filter "http" to select all HTTP packets.
Wireshark will display all the HTTP packets captured in the pcap file. You can right-click on a packet and select "Follow TCP Stream" to see the entire HTTP message.
To save the extracted HTTP content, select "File" -> "Export Objects" -> "HTTP" and choose the HTTP packets you want to export.

*To extract each VoIP call from the pcap file:
Open the saved pcap file in Wireshark.
Use the filter tool to select VoIP packets. For example, you can use the filter "sip || rtp" to select SIP and RTP protocols.
Wireshark will display all the VoIP packets captured in the pcap file. You can right-click on a packet and select "Follow UDP Stream" to see the entire VoIP call.
To save the extracted VoIP calls, select "File" -> "Export Objects" -> "RTP" and choose the VoIP packets you want to export.
